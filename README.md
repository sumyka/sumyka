## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm just a university student majoring in InfoTech, dabbling in TypeScript on Node.js.
When I started university, I decided to leave my old GitHub account behind and create this brand-new one to match this new chapter in my life.
Time for a fresh startâ€”let's gooo!

### About Me

sumyka is a bachelor's first at Chiba Institute of Technology(Japan), majoring in infoTech.
My long-term goal is to develop a reliable, firm, and secure encryption algorithm.
I'm putting in a lot of effort through study, trial and error, and researchâ€”both at university and independentlyâ€”to make that goal a reality!!!
